# Changelog

Running release-notes draft for `aggregate_api`. Newest first. The cadence
mirrors the main `aggregate` project: every plan-based change bumps the
`1.0.0a*` version and adds a section here.

## 1.0.0a1

Initial extraction and scaffolding.

- Extracted the FastAPI service and web SPA verbatim from the `aggregate` repo
  (last good state: commit `6f828ce`, before the `473bcd8` deletion) into a
  standalone project.
  - Python backend: `src/aggregate_api/` (was `src/aggregate/api/`) and its
    `routes/` + committed `static/` icons.
  - Web SPA: `web/` (Vite + Bootstrap 5 + CodeMirror 6), verbatim.
  - Tests: `tests/` (was `tests/api/`), verbatim.
  - Build scripts: `scripts/build-web.{ps1,sh}`, verbatim.
- Added project scaffolding: `pyproject.toml` (package `aggregate_api`, console
  script `aggregate-api`, `aggregate` as a dependency), `.gitignore`,
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`, and `dev/TODO.md`.

**Not yet runnable.** This release is a faithful copy in the new layout; the
package directory was renamed to `aggregate_api` but file *contents* are
unchanged, so internal `aggregate.api` self-references and the web build's
output path still point at the old location. `dev/plan-0001-bootstrap-standalone.md`
makes it import, run, and pass tests (→ 1.0.0a2).
